    <h4>Studio 3 - The Archive</h4>
    <!--Add a blog entry (including header, subheader, and date) to your blog, that includes a screen capture of your final design and an explanation of how you connected your various visual elements in the user interface with the interactive/experiential design. List three aspect about your solution that you think support effective and interesting interface design-->
    <p>The user interface I will be evaluating today is the interface of my studio 3 assignment called "The Archive."
        <br>

        <br>
        <br> I decided to do an archive of the five allergies that effect me the most everyday. To depict these allergies in a user friendly way, I made simple, relatable, and rocognizable illustrations using Adobe Illustrator CC. I decided to go with
        a simple and straight forward name for my page "The Archive of Allergies" so that my user knows straight away that these are things that people are allergic to in general as well. I kept it just a simple title and simple, but well drawn illustrations
        so that the user does not get overwhelmed by too many things at once.
        <br>
        <br> When the user scrolls over each illustration, it reveals a small slightly transparent description/journal entry with a neutral complementary colored background (to differentiate each allergy when you mouse over each illustration) in white
        text (better legibility and aesthetic in my opinion in this case) about how the allergy has effected me and my thoughts and feelings about the allergy. I chose to simply just use mouseover anf mouseout commands because I thought it was all I really
        needed for my design to add some interactivity, and also it was within my capabilities and time contraints. I also didn't want to do too much and overstimulate or confuse the users or myself.
        <br>
        <br>
        I had a little trouble organizing my mouseovers
        it seems as the middle 3 images still need some work so that the description appears once the mouseovers over the image rather than when the mouseover unders the image slightly... I found it strange that the two images on the side mouse over fine.
        I would also like to figure out how to fix up the spacing of the descriptions when they appear as well.

  <h4>Form Interface Review</h4> -->
    <!-- Add a second blog entry (blog entries are usually posted with the most recent first) with a 100-300 word critical evaluation of a web-based form you use often. Base your assesment on the principles of the Bill Derouchey's article/slideshow on interface design-->
    <!-- <p>The user interface I will be evaluating today is the main interface of <a href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Forms</a> using <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects">Bill Derouchey's article/slideshow on interface design.</a>

      <br> Google forms is a free popular website and is used globally and across all system platforms to create simple and easily navigated forms.
      <br>
      <br> In terms of the visual design of Facebook, Facebook has a simple and neutral color pallette that includes primarily blacks, grays, blues and whites. facebook has organized its layouts primarily in columns. Facebook uses simple colored icon
      designs to further aid users in identifying what the link indicate.
      <br>
      <br> In terms of the effectiveness of facebooks interface design, I think Facebook has strategically, effectively, and successfully layed out all its components in the most logical sequence possible. It's navigational links are thoughtfully listed in groups and most likely most usered in general by most of its users. There is text hierarchy and small intergrated instructions on how to use features of Facbook to further effectiveness.</p> -->

    <h4>User Interface Review</h4>
    <!--Evaluate a user interface that you use often in terms of the visual design, appeal and effectiveness. This is an opportunity to communicate your ideas and pespectives on effective interface design. The entry should be approximately 150-300 words-->
    <p>The user interface I will be evaluating today is the main interface of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> when you log into your Facebook.
