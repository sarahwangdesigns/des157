    <p id="mangoinfo"><strong>Mangos</strong><br><br>Mangos used to be my favorite food but I'm actually really allergic to mangos. I used to just get horrible hives and rashes, which I would just tough it out because I loved the taste of mango so much, but ever since
        I developed asthma my freshman year at UCSD, I now get asthmatic reactions. One time I accidentally ate a small piece of mango on a fish taco with mango salsa at Segundo Dining Halls at UC Davis and I started to wheeze a bit, so the dining hall
        manager made me sign a form consenting it was my mistake for not reading the labels clearly.</p>

    <p id="avocadoinfo"><strong>Avocados</strong><br><br>I'm somewhat moderately allergic to avocados as well. This relates back to my mango allergy as both are from similar fruit families. I get sligtly asthmatic with this allergy as well, but with this specific allergy,
        my eyes tear up like crazy. Everytime I go out to eat poke bowls and sushi, which are two of my favorite foods, I always have to ask if there is avocados in the food and if they can make it without avocado. It's pretty sad. :/ It's okay, though.
        I dont particularly like avocados anyways.</p>

    <p id="doginfo"><strong>Dogs</strong><br><br>I'm actually really allergic to dogs. I can tolerate dogs for about 0.5-1.0 hours before I start feeling like im dying. I can only admire them from afar after that. ): IT'S SO SAD BECAUSE I LOVE DOGS SO MUCH. I really
        want a dog sometime after I graduate, so I've been considering allergy shots because I want a fluffy companion, specifically a corgi, who will give me unconditional love and never disappoint me. :)</p>

    <p id="catinfo"><strong>Cats</strong><br><br>I'm actually really really allergic to cats. I get an immediate allergic reaction though short contact or even walking into an environment that a cat lives in. It's not only an asthmatic reaction, but the whole shebang
        of wheezing, watery eyes, sneezing, runny nose, and itchyness. It's pretty intolerable. I literally can only admire them from afar. IT'S SO SAD BECAUSE I ALSO LOVE CATS A LOT. I considered getting a cat but I don't think I could handle the allergic
        reactions even if I started allergy shots. My dream when I was younger was to get an orange tabby cat, but that dream has now died. :)</p>

    <p id="nickelinfo"><strong>Nickel</strong><br><br>I'm allergic to nickel and similar metals to it as well. I can't wear "cheap" jewelry for more than a few hours before i start getting really itchy. I can only wear probably certain purities of silver, gold, or platnium.
        It's really sad because I want to accessorize like everyone else does. ;-; RIP me. But I guess it saves me some money... but not really since I still want to accessorize and all my jewelry have to be gold and costs me $100+ for every piece...</p>
