                    <h1>CATCALL RESPONSE GENERATOR</h1>
                        <p>I want to create some kind of app interface that will address the issue of catcalling. The goal of the app is to inform the user what catcalling is and provide them possible respectful and neutral responses they could use, if they choose to respond to their offender. There will be several categories to choose from based on most common locations or spaces people get catcalled at and based on occupation. The app will also provide a forum for people to gather to share their stories and help each other cope and deal with their catcalling issues and further online resources to help with catcalling.</p>
